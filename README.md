# Patch Briefs

Narrative Strategy Maps generated by Patch 🦊

## What Is This?

A live brief generation system. Mike has a conversation, Patch creates the brief, pushes it live. Near real-time narrative synthesis.

## Structure

```
.
├── briefs/           # Individual brief folders
│   └── patch/        # Patch's self-brief (meta)
├── core/             # Shared design assets
├── index.html        # Directory landing page
└── netlify.toml      # Deployment config
```

## Workflow

1. **Record** — Mike has a conversation (voice memo, transcript)
2. **Upload** — Transcript goes to shared watch folder
3. **Generate** — Patch creates the brief from transcript
4. **Push** — Auto-deploys to Netlify
5. **Share** — Link ready before the conversation ends
