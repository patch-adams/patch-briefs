#### Krisnan Brief - Original Concept
- **URL**: N/A (no external reference)
- **Brief**: Krisnan (Odyssey Works Faculty)
- **Concept**: Illuminated manuscript meets modern editorial
- **Key Design Choices**:
  - **Light mode** (first light-mode brief)
  - Parchment/cream/terracotta/ink palette
  - Single column, text-forward layout
  - Cormorant Garamond serif for body text
  - Drop caps on opening paragraphs
  - Simple ◊ dividers instead of icons
  - No gradients, no effects, no orbs
  - Ice dots visualization for "islands of coherence"
- **Why It Works**: Content about Vedic wisdom and cultural fire demanded something that felt like a sacred text transmission, not a tech landing page
